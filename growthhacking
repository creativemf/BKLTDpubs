I've been a 'growth hacker' since the dawn of the Internet. For what its worth, folks like Aurelia Harvey,  Mark Zuckerberg, Sean Parker,
John (Crispus Attucks) Lee, and PUD (Philip Kaplan) are the orginal 'growth hackers' _

Genuine hacking is not (just) "coding" for the sake of "writing clean code" and having a chat about it of P&J
– its about INNOVATION and having #meta multiple skillsets at near mastery levels:

√ Conceptual design
√ Creative writing/Creative coding
√ Research 
√ The ability to DRAW. And WELL _
√ Good at Maths, Science and Philosophy
√ Culturally savvy chops
√ A Media Swami (deathrow (!) _ how low can you go?)

More to come ...

BK!
